        Summary</h2>\n<p>\nThe November 13, 2016 M 7.8 earthquake in North Canterbury,
        New Zealand, occurred as the result of shallow oblique-reverse faulting on
        or near the boundary between the Pacific and Australia plates in South Island,
        New Zealand. At the location of this earthquake, the Pacific plate moves to
        the west-southwest with respect to the Australia plate at a rate of approximately
        40 mm/yr. The epicenter of the earthquake is about 30-45 km south-southeast
        of the main surface expression of the plate boundary in the region\u2014the
        Hope Fault, part of the Marlborough Fault system that connects a subduction
        zone (the Hikurangi Trough) to the primary plate boundary in the South Island\u2014the
        Alpine Fault. The plate boundary in the region of the earthquake is complex,
        involving a transition from subduction along the Hikurangi Trough to the east
        of the North Island, to transform faulting through the South Island. The shallow
        crustal region to the southeast of the Hope fault primarily involves thin-skinned
        shortening and fold and thrust belt tectonics. The size, depth (~25 km) and
        faulting orientation of the November 13 event suggest a larger, subduction-related
        structure, though the subduction zone interface is not thought to extend this
        far to the south. The complexity of the event, involving a main energy release
        delayed by about 40 s, combined with an early aftershock distribution extending
        about 150 km to the north-northeast of the mainshock, suggests the potential
        for triggered slip on the Pacific:Australia subduction zone interface.\n</p><p>\nWhile
        commonly plotted as points on maps, earthquakes of this size are more appropriately
        described as slip over a larger fault area. Reverse-faulting events of the
        size of the November 13, 2016 earthquake are typically about 120x50 km (length
        x width). Modeling of this event implies slip occurred over an area about
        200x60 km in size. Over the 9 hours following the M 7.8 mainshock, 25 aftershocks
        have occurred, ranging in size from M 4.5 to M 6.5 and extending from the
        region of the mainshock epicenter to about 160 km to the northeast.\n</p><p>\nThe
        Pacific-Australia plate boundary in northern South Island has a history of
        large earthquakes both along the plate boundary proper and distributed around
        the plate boundary internal to the Australia and Pacific plates. The November
        13th M 7.8 earthquake is the largest event in the region since an M 7.3 earthquake
        100 km to the northwest in June 1929. That June 1929 earthquake occurred just
        3 months after the March 1929 Arthur\u2019s Pass strike-slip earthquake, 90
        km to the west-southwest of the November 13th event. The Arthur\u2019s Pass
        event caused damage but injured no one. The November 13, 2016 event is also
        about 100 km to the north of Christchurch, which was severely damaged by a
        series of large earthquakes in 2010-2015, including a M 7.0 to the west of
        Christchurch in September 2010, and a M 6.1 directly beneath the city in February
        2011.\n</p><p>\nBecause of the complexity of this plate boundary region, strain
        is being accommodated on many different structures of varying orientations,
        making it possible that more than one fault may be activated in this earthquake
        sequence.\n</p>"}}}],"geoserve":[{"indexid":"133793221","indexTime":1486151895662,"id":"urn:usgs-product:us:geoserve:us1000778i:1486151864040","type":"geoserve","code":"us1000778i","source":"us","updateTime":1486151864040,"status":"UPDATE","properties":{"eventsource":"us","eventsourcecode":"1000778i","location":"54km
