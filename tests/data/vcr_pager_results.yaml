        Summary</h2>\n<p>\nThe September 5, 2018, M 6.6 earthquake east of Tomakomai,
        on the island of Hokkaido, Japan, occurred as the result of shallow reverse
        faulting. Focal mechanism solutions for the earthquake indicate faulting occurred
        on either a moderately dipping reverse fault striking northwest, or on a shallow-to-moderately
        dipping fault striking southeast. At the location of this earthquake, the
        Pacific plate is moving towards the west-northwest at a velocity of about
        87 mm/yr relative to the North America plate, subducting beneath Japan and
        Eurasia at the Japan and Kuril-Kamchatka Trenches to the east of the September
        5th earthquake. Note that some authors divide this region into several microplates
        that together define the relative motions between among the larger Pacific,
        North America and Eurasia plates; these include the Okhotsk and Amur microplates
        that are part of North America and Eurasia, respectively. Given the depth
        and focal mechanism solutions of this earthquake, the event likely represents
        rupture of a fault within the North America (upper) plate (or Okhotsk microplate),
        rather than on the subduction zone plate boundary interface between the Pacific
        and North America plates, which is at a depth of approximately 100 km at the
        location of this earthquake. Slip on a fault aligned with either nodal plane
        of the focal mechanism solution is consistent with this intraplate setting.\n</p><p>\nThis
        reverse-faulting earthquake occurred in a collisional belt whose tectonics
        are driven by the convergence of the Pacific, Eurasia and North America plates.
        Hokkaido is made up of accreted terrain that roughly parallels the plate boundary
        to the east, and today\u2019s earthquake is located in the Oshima Belt region.
        Japanese seismic hazard maps indicate this earthquake was located in close
        proximity to the Nohoro-Kyuryo fault zone, with high hazard and an expected
        maximum magnitude of M~7.\n</p><p>\nWhile large earthquakes are common in
        Japan, and regularly cause damage, few moderate-to-large shallow intraplate
        earthquakes have occurred in the vicinity of today\u2019s earthquake. Over
        the preceding century, 70 earthquakes of M 6 or larger have occurred within
        250 km of the September 5th earthquake, though only 6 of these occurred at
        shallow depths beneath Hokkaido. The most recent of these six upper plate
        events was a M 6.4 earthquake about 100 km to the east of today\u2019s event
        in January, 1970. \n</p><p>\nOver the first 14 hours following the September
        5th earthquake, the USGS have located 7 aftershocks of M 4.3 and larger. Two
        of these were larger than M 5, and the largest was M 5.4. News reports indicate
        that significant landsliding was triggered by the M 6.6 mainshock, burying
        houses in the epicentral region. At the time of writing, there have been 7
        reported fatalities, hundreds of injuries, and dozens of people reported missing.
